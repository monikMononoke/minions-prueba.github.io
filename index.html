            The Minions are small, yellow, capsule shaped creatures, who have
            one or two eyes. They bring much of the comedy in the film, and they
            are known as the scene-stealer of the movie. Frequently, they speak
            in an incomprehensible language, called Minionese, occasionally
            switching to English. They are much childish in some ways, yet they
            seem to be very intelligent in certain aspects.
